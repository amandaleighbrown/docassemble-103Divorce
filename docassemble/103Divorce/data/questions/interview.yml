  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: _Petition_for_Divorce__No_Children
continue button field: _Divorce_No_Children_intro
question: |
  Who can use this application?
subquestion: |
  **You can only use this form builder if all of these are true:**
  
    * **If there are not minor children of the marriage,** you and your spouse have already been living separate and apart for at least 180 days without getting back together (called "reconciling")
    * **If there are  minor children of the marriage,** you and your spouse have already been living separate and apart for at least 365 days without reconciling
    * You **or** your spouse are currently "{domiciled}" in Louisiana for at least 6 months
    * Your spouse **is not** in prison
    * Your spouse **is not** an active duty servicemember in the U.S. Military
    * You and your spouse **are not** in a “{covenant marriage}”.
        
  By continuing, you are agreeing that all of the above things are true.
---
id: Before You Begin
continue button field: before_you_begin
question: |
  Before you start
subquestion: |
  **Please note** that these forms are for a simple uncontested divorce only. The forms do not address spousal support, child support, domestic abuse, or community property. **You may need to address these issues using separate forms, or by finding an attorney to represent you.** You should consult a lawyer if domestic violence or interim spousal support relief are essential to your case as the timing of a divorce may affect the relief obtained.
  
  You will be filing your divorce as a “self-represented litigant.” That means you are moving your case forward without a lawyer. As the person suing for divorce, you are the **“Petitioner”** and your spouse is the **“Defendant.”** All the forms you need to file for a divorce are attached or referenced in these instructions. The forms assume that your spouse will not challenge or respond to the divorce.
---
id: Info_Required
question: |
  What do you need to get started?
subquestion: | 
  You need to know the following before starting this form:
  
  * The exact date and parish/county where you were married
  * The exact date you physically separated from your spouse and began living apart
  * Whether you will use the "{In Forma Pauperis}" procedure to delay (but not eliminate) having to pay your case filing fees. ([See if you likely qualify.](https://www.bit.ly/in-forma-pauperis))

terms:
  In Forma Pauperis: |
    In forma pauperis (or IFP) allows you to file your case without paying court costs up front. It only **delays** the court costs, and they will still be required at the end of the case. It requires a separate form and is only available to people that qualify. 
  jurisdiction: |
    Jurisdiction is a court's official power to make legal decisions and judgments. 
  covenant marriage: |
    A covenant marriage is a special type of marriage. To have a covenant marriage, you would have agreed to pre-marriage counseling and a longer time for living separate and apart. You would have also completed a “Declaration of Intent” and filed it with your marriage certificate.
  service: |
    Service is the way a party to a lawsuit gets official notice of the case. ["Learn more"](https://louisianalawhelp.org/resource/understanding-service-of-process-article).
  domiciled: |
    A person's “domicile ” is their main residence where they usually reside and intend to remain.

id: Serving your divorce papers
question: |
  Will ${ respondents[0].name.first } waive service of process and accept the divorce papers from you directly?
subquestion: |
  The law requires that ${ respondents[0].name.first } be notified of your divorce lawsuit through a process called "{service}". 
  
  If you and ${ respondents[0].name.first } agree on the divorce and are on speaking terms, they can accept the papers directly from you and sign an affidavit in front of a notary saying they received them from you. This can save time and money.
  
  If ${ respondents[0].name.first } won't accept the papers, that's ok. You can serve them through the regular service process.

template: service_options_explanation
subject: |
  💡 What are my options for serving ${ respondents[0].name.first }?
content: | 
  There are two types of service: "personal service" and "domiciliary service." You can use either to serve divorce papers.
  
  For personal service, ${ respondents[0].name.first } needs to be directly handed the divorce papers. This can happen wherever they can be physically found, including home, work, or a friend's house.
  
  For domiciliary service, the divorce papers must be served to "a person of suitable age and discretion" wherever ${ respondents[0].name.first } considers "home." Someone like a spouse, parent, or even an older, teenaged child would be ok.
